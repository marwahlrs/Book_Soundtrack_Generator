Generate a Spotify playlist based on the vibe of any book you’ve read.
Just enter a book’s title and author. This project will:
- Fetch the summary using the Google Books API
- Analyze the book’s mood using Gemini (Google’s LLM)
- Generate a Spotify playlist that matches the book’s vibe

You’ll need your own API keys for:
- Google Books API
- Gemini
- Spotify API

Input your API keys in the notebook to get started.
